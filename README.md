# RUDRA

Student engineer exploring AI, systems, and intelligent design.

I like building things that **hold up under real conditions**, not just ideas that look impressive once.  
Most of my work focuses on understanding how systems behave, where they fail, and how to design them better.

Python is my primary language — it’s where most of my thinking happens. I use it to experiment with AI concepts, prototype ideas, and build systems that value clarity and reliability. When ideas need a visible form, I work with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I prefer learning by doing: building, breaking, fixing, and refining. Iteration matters more to me than perfection.

## What I Work With
- Python (primary)
- AI / ML fundamentals
- System-oriented problem solving
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript

---

## What I Like Building
- Intelligent systems that solve real constraints  
- Tools that optimize processes instead of just predicting outcomes  
- Projects where structure and logic matter more than hype  

---

## Achievements
- 🏆 **Winner — Atherion 22K25 Hackathon**
- Founding Coordinator of a National-Level Tech Fest
- Built a **supply chain optimization system** for automated analysis and decision-making

## Beyond Code
I also enjoy graphic design, drawing, video editing, and gaming.  
Fun fact: I designed the banner you’re seeing here — and yes, I instinctively say **“pspsps”** to cats.

## How I Approach Technology
I don’t see AI as magic or shortcuts.  
To me, it’s a tool — useful only when it’s grounded in logic, constraints, and real-world behavior.

I enjoy working on problems where:
- trade-offs matter  
- assumptions are tested  
- and solutions need to adapt, not just respond  

Understanding *why* something works is as important to me as making it work.

Learning is ongoing.  
This GitHub is a record of that process.

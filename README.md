# RUDRA

Student engineer exploring AI, systems, and intelligent design.

I like building things that **hold up under real conditions**, not just ideas that look impressive once.  
Most of my work focuses on understanding how systems behave, where they fail, and how to design them better.

Python is my primary language — it’s where most of my thinking happens. I use it to experiment with AI concepts, prototype ideas, and build systems that value clarity and reliability. When ideas need a visible form, I work with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I prefer learning by doing: building, breaking, fixing, and refining. Iteration matters more to me than perfection.

## What I Work With
- Python (primary)
- AI / ML fundamentals
- System-oriented design
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript

---

## What I Like Building
- AI systems that don’t confidently make things up  
- Structured experiments that evolve into tools  
- Projects where logic and design matter more than hype  

---

## Achievements
- 🏆 **Winner — Atherion 22K25 Hackathon**
- Founding Coordinator of a National-Level Tech Fest
- Built agent-based systems for automated analysis and decision-making

## Beyond Code
I also enjoy graphic design, drawing, video editing, and gaming.  
Fun fact: I designed the banner you’re seeing here — and yes, I instinctively say **“pspsps”** to cats.

## How I Think About AI
I prefer:
> “This system works.”  

over:
> “This prompt worked once.”

Reliability, structure, and clarity matter more than clever tricks.

Learning is ongoing.  
This GitHub is a record of that process.
